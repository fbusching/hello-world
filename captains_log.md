Week1
my name is Forrest Busching and i am a student majoring in physic.
technical writing is a way to describe a procedure to someone with the assmption that they are new to what you are writing about.
It alings pretty well with the reading.it explains that the writing should be for the reader to understand.
i noticed that it uses easy to follow, short instructions. with pictures, bullet points, and examples.the writing provides questions that the reader might have, and explains what pourpose of the task is. there are many pictures that explain visually where you should be in the project.
the audience for the progamming historian would be people who have an interest in a specific field of reasearch and would like to understand the reaserch being done. piercehacker is designed for readers who dont know how to use a specific program or a technology. to explain reasearch topics through technical writing. to help eople through proplems they might be having wiyth technology through toutorial. so that the help or information can be easily acessesd by anyone who needs to get their projects done without wasting too much time.
i learned the importance of public websites and how to prototype ideas.


Week2 
I decided to use a picture for each instruction so that if thaere was any confusion, it would quickly be eleviated. some ofthe pictures requiered weird angles to show what the instuctions are saying.the instuctions themselvese are pretty straightforward. it was very simpleto write the instuctions , not only because i seperated them for each different sub build, but because i knew the names of the little pieces and how they fit together.  
an audience that could eaisily interpert the instuctions. mabey an audience with average lego experience, but not expert level. so mabey 12ish and up. i thought it would be a good idea to condense the ideas as much as possible to keep them from being overcomplicated. 
i delivered my instuctions via powerpoint. there was one major factor that motivated the choice. it was efficiency. powerpoint made it so that i could have one slide per mini build. none of them overlap.it got me to the understandin that efficiency is  a very important tool in technical writing. no unecessary fluff.
i learned how to effectivly turn ideas into understandable, interpertable instructions.


week3
thinking of an original question that was valid. it makes me understand that anything unecessary in a question just add to any confusion.
people who are struggleling with use ful technology. to help those people.so that the people who need the help can easily access it as quickly as possible.
