my name is Forrest Busching and i am a student majoring in physic.
technical writing is away to describe a procedure to someone with the assmption that they are new to what you are writing about.
It alings pretty well with the reading.
i noticed that it uses easy to follow, short instructions. with pictures, bullet points, and examples.
